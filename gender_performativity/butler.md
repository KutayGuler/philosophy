We act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or something that is simply true about us, a fact, about us. Actually, it's a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time. So to say gender is performative, is to say that **nobody really is a gender from the start.**

â€” Judith Butler
