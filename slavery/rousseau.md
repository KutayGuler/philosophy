To renounce freedom is to renounce one's humanity, one's  rights as a man and equally one's duties. There is no possible  *quid pro quo* fro one who renounces everything; indeed such   renunciation is contrary to man's very nature; for if you take  away all freedom of the will, you strip a man's actions of all   moral significance. Finally, any covenant which stipulated  absolute dominion for one party and absolute obedience for  the other would be illogical and nugatory. Is it not evident  that he who is entitled to demand everything owes nothing?  And does not the single fact of there being no reciprocity,  no mutual obligation, nullify the act? **For what right can my  slave have against me? If everything he has belongs to me,  his rights is *my* right, and it would be nonsense to speak of  my having a right *against* myself.**

â€” Jean Jacques Rousseau
